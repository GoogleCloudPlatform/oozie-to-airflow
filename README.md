Python3.6 is required to run the project.

We are using a number of checks for quality checks of the code. They are verified during Travis build but
also you can install pre-commit hook by running:

`pre-commit install`


You can run all the checks manually by running:

`pre-commit run --all-files`

You can always skip running the tests by providing `--no-verify` flag to `git commit` command.

You can check all commands of pre-commit framework at https://pre-commit.com/
